# Statistical programming

## Data work in development research

More generally, for any of the processes in development research, we'll call data work everything that:

1. Starts with a data input
1. Runs some process with the data
1. Produces an output with the result

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/1-intro/data-work.png")
```

---

# Statistical programming

## So what do we mean by statistical programming?

- Programming consists of producing instructions for a computer to do something
- In the context of data work, that "something" is statistical analysis, mathematical operations, or data transformations
- Hence, statistical programming consists of producing instructions so our computers will conduct statistical analysis on data
- From now on, we're going to refer to these instructions for data processes as **code**

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="55%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/1-intro/data-work-with-instructions.png")
```

---

# Statistical programming

## Reproducibility

In science, the formal definition of reproducibility was provided by [Bollen et al. (2015)](https://www.nsf.gov/sbe/AC_Materials/SBE_Robust_and_Reliable_Research_Report.pdf):

*the ability [â€¦] to duplicate the results of a prior study using the same materials and procedures as were used by the original investigator*

this translates to data work as:

 **<font size="7">The ability to reproduce outputs using the same code and data inputs.</font>**

This is also usually referred to as *computational reproducibility*.

## How to write R code?

The rest of this session focuses on the basics of writing R code...

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/1-intro/data-work-basis.png")
```

---

# Writing R code

## How to write R code?

- We'll use RStudio to write R code in this training

- Now open RStudio in your computer

- Please make sure you're opening RStudio and not R

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/1-intro/r-rstudio.png")
```

# Writing R code

## Exercise 1: writing code in the console

1. Write the following code in the console of RStudio

  + `print("hello world")`
  + Make sure to include the quotes: `" "`

1. Press Enter to run the code

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="60%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/1-intro/console.png")
```

---

# Writing R code

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="90%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/1-intro/exercise1.png")
```

---

# Writing R code

## Exercise 2: writing a short script

.pull-left5[
- Open a new script with `File` >> `New File` >> `R Script`

- Write or copy the following text into the script

```{r eval=FALSE}
print("hello")
print("bonjour")
print("hola")
print("bom dia")
```
  
1. Select the text you introduced with your mouse

1. Press "Run"
]
.pull-right5[
```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="90%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/1-intro/script.png")
```
]

---

# Writing R code

## R scripts

.pull-left[
- Writing and running code from the console will execute it immediately

- Writing code in the script panel allow us to write multiple lines of code and execute them later

  + Each line is executed in order
  
  + The line and the results will show in the console
  
- **Important:** for the rest of the training, remember to always introduce your code in the script (and not in the console) so you can keep record of what you did
]

.pull-right[
```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="90%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/1-intro/exercise2.png")
```
]

---

# Writing R code

## R scripts

- In other words: scripts contain the instructions you give to your computer when doing data work

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/1-intro/data-work-script.png")
```

---

# Writing R code

## Creating objects in R

- Remember we also mentioned the environment panel? that's where R keeps track of objects

- Objects are representations of data that currently exist in R's memory

  + A single number can be an object
  + A word can be an object
  + Even an entire data file can be an object

- We create objects in R with the arrow operator (`<-`)

- Example: creating an object called `x`

```{r eval=FALSE}
x <- 10
```

---

# Writing R code

## Creating objects in R

- After an object is created, we can refer to it using its name

```{r}
x <- 10
print(x)
print(x + 5)
```

---

# Writing R code

## Creating objects in R

- After an object is created, it will show in the environment panel

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="90%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/1-intro/environment.png")
```

---

# Writing R code

## Exercise 3: operations with objects

1. Create an object called `x1` in your script and assign to it the value of 50

2. Create an object called `x2` and make it equal to 15

3. Create an object called `x3` and make it the sum of x1 and x2

4. Print `x3`. It should show the value 65

```{r eval=FALSE}
x1 <- 50
x2 <- 15
x3 <- x1 + x2
print(x3)
```

---

# Writing R code

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="90%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/1-intro/exercise3.png")
```

---

# Writing R code

- These are the very basics of writing R code. You'll become more familiarized with it in this and the next sessions

- Now we know how to use RStudio to write R code and produce scripts

- However, we haven't still introduced the data to our data work. That comes next

# Data in R

## Exercise 4: Loading data into R

.pull-left[
1. Click on this link: http://bit.ly/msfr24_materials and download the file `treat_status.csv`

2. In RStudio, go to `File` > `Import Dataset` > `From Text (base)` and select the file `treat_status.csv`
  + If you don't know where the file is, check in your `Downloads` folder
  
3. Make sure to select `Heading` > `Yes` in the next window

4. Select `Import`
]

.pull-right[
```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="90%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/1-intro/import-data.png")
```
]

---

# Data in R

- If you did this correctly, you will note that a viewer of the data now appears in RStudio
- You can click on the `x` next to `treat_status` to return to the script
- To open the viewer again, use the code: `View(treat_status)` (notice the uppercase "V")

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="75%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/1-intro/data-viewer.png")
```

---

# Data in R

- Additionally, you will now see an object named `treat_status` in your environment

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/1-intro/environment2.png")
```

---

# Data in R

- Remember we mentioned objects before? For R, `treat_status` is an object just like `x1`, `x2`, or `x3`

- The difference is that `treat_status` is not a single number like `x1`, but a collection of numeric values similar to an Excel spreadsheet. In R, this type of objects are called **dataframes**

- From now, we will refer to data loaded into R as **dataframes**

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/1-intro/environment2-1.png")
```

---

# Data in R

## A note about this dataframe

Knowing the data you use is extremely important. For the lab sessions, `treat_status` is a dataframe with data about villages, their treatment status in the project, and the districts they are located.

- Variable (column) `vid` is the village identifier
- `Treatment` is a dummy with information about the village treatment status
- `district` is the name of the village district

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/1-intro/data-viewer.png")
```

---

# Data in R

## Exercise 5: Understanding data in R

1. Use the following code to subset (filter) `treat_status` and leave only the villages in the treatment group: `subset(treat_status, Treatment == 1)`

  + Note that the `T` in `Treatment` needs to be **uppercase** because that's how the variable is named in the dataframe
  + Note that there are **two equal signs** in the condition, not one
  
1. Use `View(treat_status)` to visualize the dataframe again and see how it changed (note the uppercase "V")

---

# Data in R

Does anything look out of place?

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/1-intro/exercise5.png")
```

---

# Data in R

- Indeed, the dataframe `treat_status` didn't change

- That is because we didn't use the arrow operator (`<-`) to store the result in an object

- Instead, R only printed the result in the console for us (and nothing else)

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/1-intro/exercise5-annotated.png")
```

---

# Data in R

## Exercise 6: Operating with data and storing the result

- Subset the dataframe again and save the result into a new dataframe called `treated_villages`. You can use this code for that:

  ```{r eval=FALSE}
  treated_villages <- subset(treat_status, Treatment == 1)
  ```

- Use `View(treated_villages)` to visualize the result (notice the uppercase "V")

---

# Data in R

Now the resulting dataframe looks correct!

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="85%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/1-intro/exercise6.png")
```

---

# Data in R

Note that this time R didn't print the resulting dataframe in the console, it only showed the code we were running. Also, now the new dataframe appears in the environment.

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="85%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/1-intro/exercise6-annotated.png")
```

---

# Data in R

- R can store multiple dataframes in the environment. This is analogous to having different spreadsheets in the same Excel window

- Remember that dataframes are just objects in R. R differentiates which dataframe the code refers to with the dataframe name

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="60%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/1-intro/environment3.png")
```

# Functions in R

<html><div style='float:left'></div><hr color='#D38C28' size=1px width=1100px></html>

---

# Functions in R

- Functions are how we apply operations to objects in R

- We have used a few functions in the previous exercises. For example, `subset()` and `View()` are functions

- Everything that has a name plus parentheses is a function in R

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="95%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/1-intro/function.png")
```

---

# Functions in R

Functions have the following elements:

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="95%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/1-intro/function-elements.png")
```

- **Function name:** the name we use to call a function. It goes before the parentheses

- **Arguments:** inputs and specifications for the function to be applied.

  + Arguments go inside the parentheses and are separated by commas
  + The first argument is the object you apply the function on

---

# Functions in R

- The results of a function can always be stored in an object with the arrow operator (`<-`)

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="95%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/1-intro/function-stored.png")
```

- As we saw in exercise 5, the results of a function will only be printed in the console if you don't store them

# R libraries

<html><div style='float:left'></div><hr color='#D38C28' size=1px width=1100px></html>

---

# R libraries

- Installing R in your computer gives you access to its basic functions

- Additionally, you can also install libraries. Libraries are packages of additional R functions that allow you to do:

  + Operations that basic R functions don't do (example: geospatial data analysis)
  
  + Operations that basic R functions do, but easier (example: data cleaning)

- Libraries are also called **packages**. Both terms refer to the same in R work

---

# R libraries

In a nutshell:

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="90%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/1-intro/r-libraries.png")
```

---

# R libraries

We'll install two libraries that we'll use extensively in the labs: `haven` and `here`

## Exercise 7: Installing libraries

1. Install the libraries with `install.packages()`:

 + Run in the console: `install.packages("here")`
 + Run in the console: `install.packages("haven")`
 + Note the quotes (`" "`) in the package names
 + **Introduce this code in the console**, not the script panel

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="40%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/1-intro/install-haven.png")
```

---

# R libraries

## Installing libraries

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="90%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/1-intro/installing-haven.png")
```

---

# R libraries

Now that the libraries are installed, we only need to load them to start using the functions they have.

## Exercise 8: Loading libraries

.pull-left[
1. Load `haven` with: `library(haven)`

1. Load `here` with `library(here)`

1. Load `dplyr` with `library(dplyr)`

  + Run this code **from the script panel** this time, not the console
  + Notice that we don't use quotes in the library names this time
  + If loading `dplyr` fails, install it with `install.packages("dplyr")`
]
.pull-right[
```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="95%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/1-intro/loading-haven.png")
```
]

---

# R libraries

- Library installation:

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="37%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/1-intro/installation.png")
```

- Library loading:

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="37%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/1-intro/loading.png")
```

- You install R libraries only once in your computer

- You load libraries every time you open a new RStudio window (only load the libraries you will use)

class: inverse, center, middle
name: file-paths

# File paths

<html><div style='float:left'></div><hr color='#D38C28' size=1px width=1100px></html>

---

# File paths

File paths are the location of a file or folder in your computer. For example:

```{r eval=FALSE}
C:/WBG/Repos/manage-successful-field-research/2024/R/Presentations/1-intro.Rmd
```

is the location of this presentation file in my computer.

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="65%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/1-intro/file-path-session1.png")
```

---

# File paths

- File paths are important because they define the route from which your computer reads input data or exports outputs

- Remember when you manually loaded `treat_status.csv` in exercise 4? you were using a file path implicitly. This is how the command for loading the data was implicitly applied in my computer:

```{r eval=FALSE}
treat_status <- read.csv("C:/Users/wb532468/Downloads/treat_status.csv")
```

- This will look different for your computer because the path to your `Downloads` folder is not going to be the same

---

# File paths

## Relative and absolute file paths

- Absolute file paths define a location starting from a disk in Windows (`C:/`) or the folder `/Users/` in Mac.

  + For example: `C:/Users/wb532468/Downloads/treat_status.csv`

- Relative file paths define the location of a file relative to an "anchor" location.

  + For example: `Downloads/treat_status.csv` is the relative path of `treat_status.csv` with respect of `C:/Users/wb532468`

---

# File paths

## Relative and absolute file paths

- You can use both in R

- Relative file paths will work with respect of the current working directory where R is located. You can check it with the function `getwd()`

```{r}
getwd()
```

- In Windows, the default working directory when starting R is the Documents folder

---

# File paths

## Relative and absolute file paths

- The current working directory will always be the "anchor" for relative paths in R

- You can change it with the function `setwd()`, as in:

```{r eval=FALSE}
setwd("C:/path/that/only/exists/in/my/computer")
```

- However, we absolutely recommend not to do it

- Why? **Because having code that sets a working directory with a path that only exists in your computer will break reproducibility**

---

# File paths

## RStudio projects and `here`

- Instead, you should use RStudio projects and the library `here`

- RStudio projects automatically sets the working directory to a "project" folder, so you can use it as anchor to work with relative paths that will work for everyone else that uses the same folder structure

- This is crucial because it allows smooth interoperability between different computers where the exact path to the project root directory differs

- This will become clearer with next two exercises

---

# File paths

Save your current script by clicking in the floppy disk icon **before starting this exercise**.

## Exercise 9

1. Create a folder named `msfr-r-labs` in your preferred location in your computer

1. Go to http://bit.ly/msfr24_materials and download the file: `DataWork.zip`

1. Unzip `DataWork.zip` in the folder `msfr-r-labs`

1. On RStudio, select `File` > `New Project...`

1. Select `Existing Directory`

1. Browse to the location of `msfr-r-labs` and select `Create Project`

1. RStudio will restart after this

---

# File paths

## RStudio projects

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="90%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/1-intro/exercise10.png")
```

---

# File paths

## RStudio projects

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/1-intro/exercise10a.png")
```

---

# File paths

## Using `here`

- `here` locates files relative to your project root

- It uses the root project directory to build paths to files easily

- It allows for interoperability between different computers where the absolute path to the same file is not the same

---

# File paths

## Using `here`

- Now you'll be able to use `here()` to at point the location of every file relative to your project root

  + For example, to load a `csv` file located in: `C:/WBG/project-root-name/data/raw/data-file.csv`, you should use:
  
```{r, eval=FALSE}
path <- here("data", "raw", "data-file.csv")
df <- read.csv(path)
```

- __Notes:__

  + Your project root is the directory that contains the `.Rproj` file
  + The arguments of here are the consecutive subfolders where your file is located. The final argument is the file name **with the file extension**
  + The result of `here()` is an absolute path that points to a file or folder location in your computer

---

# File paths

## Exercise 10

1\. Start a new script with `File` > `New File` > `R Script` 

2\. Load the libraries `here` and `haven` with `library()`

3\. Create an object called `path` that will be a file path to `DataWork/data/raw/TZA_CCT_baseline.dta`. Use `here()` for this:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
here("DataWork", "Data", "Raw", "TZA_CCT_baseline.dta")
```

4\. Use `read_stata()` to load the file and assign it to an object with `<-`. The argument of `read_stata()` should be the object `path`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Loading libraries
library(here)
library(haven)

# Importing data
path <- here("DataWork", "Data", "Raw", "TZA_CCT_baseline.dta")
baseline <- read_stata(path)
```

---

# File paths

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Loading libraries
library(here)
library(haven)

# Importing data
path <- here("DataWork", "data", "raw", "TZA_CCT_baseline.dta")
baseline <- read_stata(path)
```

Some notes:

+ The lines that start with `#` are code comments. R doesn't run these lines. We're using them to create small sections in the script

+ It's usual for R scrips to start with a section loading libraries and a next section loading data

---

# File paths

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Loading libraries
library(here)
library(haven)

# Importing data
path <- here("DataWork", "data", "raw", "TZA_CCT_baseline.dta")
baseline <- read_stata(path)
```

Some more notes:

+ `read_stata()` is a function from the library `haven`. You can only use it after loading `haven` with `library(haven)` (we did this already in exercise 9)
  
+ The same happens with `here()`, which is a function from the library `here`. You can only use `here()` after having run `library(here)` (exercise 9)

+ Remember to assign the dataframe you're reading to an object. You can call it `baseline` as we did before

---

# File paths

If you did the exercise correctly, you should see `baseline` listed in the environment panel

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/1-intro/exercise11.png")
```

class: inverse, center, middle
name: piping

# Piping

<html><div style='float:left'></div><hr color='#D38C28' size=1px width=1100px></html>

---

# Piping

## Functions inside functions

- R allows you to use functions inside functions. For example, this will show the summary of the logarithm of the dataframe `baseline`

```{r eval=FALSE}
summary(log(baseline$food_cons))
```

- In this case, R is taking the *output* (result) of `log(baseline$food_cons)` as the *input* of `summary()`

- Also, note that the operator `$` is subsetting the column `food_cons` from the dataframe `baseline`

---

# Piping

## Functions inside functions

- This is convenient because it saves us from having to store intermediate results into objects frequently, keeping our R environment cleaner

- However, it also has the big downside of making code convoluted and unclear, as in the example below

```{r eval=FALSE}
round(mean(log(baseline$food_cons)), 2)
```

- Piping helps keeping code clear in cases like this

---

# Piping

- The pipe operator is this: `%>%`

- Pipes are used between objects or the results of functions, as in: `log(baseline$food_cons) %>% summary()`

- The meaning of the operator is:

<font size="6">Take the output (or object) of the function at the left and pass it as the first argument of the function at the right</font>

In short:

- `x %>% function()` is the same as `function(x)`

- `x %>% function1() %>% function2()` is the same as `function2(function1(x))`

---

# Piping

Hence, these are equivalent:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# The long way, with intermediate objects:
log_food_cons <- log(baseline$food_cons)
summary(log_food_cons)

# Shorter, but code is less clear:
summary(log(baseline$food_cons))

# With pipes, clearer and with no intermediate objects:
baseline$food_cons %>% log() %>% summary()

# Note that you can also concatenate pipes and include line breaks:
baseline$food_cons %>%
  log() %>%

Pipes are part of the libraries included in the tidyverse, such as `dplyr`. When you loaded `dplyr` in exercise 9, the pipes became available for use.

# Piping

## Exercise 11: Load data with pipes

We'll load the same data we loaded manually in Exercise 4, this time with code.

1. Use the functions `here()` and `read.csv()` with pipes between them (`%>%`) to read the file `DataWork/Data/Raw/treat_status.csv`. Name the dataframe `treatment`. Some hints:

  + **Very important:** always remember to save the data read into a dataframe object with `<-`, otherwise R will only print the dataframe and it will not be stored in the environment
  
  + Remember that the arguments of `here` are the names of the folders in the path to the file, with quotes (`" "`). The last argument is the file name with the file extension, as in: `here("DataWork", "Data", "Raw", "treat_status.csv")`

1. The solution is this:

```{r eval=FALSE}
treatment <- here("DataWork", "Data", "Raw", "treat_status.csv") %>% read.csv()
```

# Piping

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Adding line breaks for code clarity:
treatment <- 
  here("DataWork", "Data", "Raw", "treat_status.csv") %>%
  read.csv()
```

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/1-intro/env-treatment.png")
```
