# Randomness and pseudorandomness

## What is randomness?

**<font size="6">Randomness is the quality or state of <i>something</i> for lacking a predefined pattern</font>**

- In statistical programming, this is usually implemented through the generation of **random numbers**

  + Random numbers in statistical programming range *usually* between 0 and 1 and have a long decimal trail, as in: `r runif(1)`
  
  + From all the possible numbers with that amount of decimal digits between 0 and 1, each of them has **the same possibility of being drawn** (uniform probability distribution)

# Randomness and pseudorandomness

## What is randomness?

- In R, you can generate a vector with random numbers with `runif(n)`, where `n` is the amount of numbers you want to generate

```{r}
runif(3)
```

# Randomness and pseudorandomness

## Randomness vs reproducibility

.pull-left2[
- We usually use of randomness in development field research to select random samples or assign treatment and control groups randomly

- And we already know that development research should be reproducible to avoid problems such as -->

# Randomness and pseudorandomness

## Randomness vs reproducibility

.pull-left2[
- True randomness, however, lacks patterns completely

- This implies that it's also impossible to reproduce: if *something* can be predicted, then it loses completely its quality of being random

- This poses a problem for conducting reproducible field research

# Randomness and pseudorandomness

## Pseudorandomness

- The solution to this philosophical problem is **pseudorandomness**

- Pseudorandomness consists of *imitating* randomness in a way that is completely reproducible

- In development and policy research, the concept of randomness **usually actually means pseudorandomness**

# Randomness and pseudorandomness

## Our scenario

For the rest of this session, we'll simulate to be in the evaluation of a program through an RCT

- **Intervention:** A conditional cash transfer

- **Population of interest:** XX villages from selected regions of Rwanda

- **Sample:** The evaluation has budget limitations that prevent to select all XX villages as part of the study, so we need to randomly only select XX of them

- **Treatment groups:** XX villages will be assigned to full treatment, XX will be assigned to a group where half of the households receive a treatment and half doesn't, and XX villages will be a full control group

## Exercise 1: Load the libraries and data

- No library installation is needed

- We'll start by loading the library and data we'll use today:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Library
library(here)

# Data
data_path <- here("DataWork", "data", "intermediate", "clean")
villages  <- readRDS(here(data_path, "LWH-villages-clean.Rds"))
hh        <- readRDS(here(data_path, "LWH-households-clean.Rds"))
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
data_path <- here("data", "DataWork", "data", "intermediate", "clean")
villages  <- readRDS(here(data_path, "LWH-villages-clean.Rds"))
hh        <- readRDS(here(data_path, "LWH-households-clean.Rds"))
```

# Sampling

<html><div style='float:left'></div><hr color='#D38C28' size=1px width=1100px></html>

# Sampling

- Sampling consists of selecting a subset of elements from a set of total elements

- Random samples are subsets generated randomly

---

# Sampling

## In R

This is implemented in statistical programming in three steps:

1. Generate a vector of n random numbers with `runif(n)`, where n is the number of elements from your total set

1. Sort the observations by the vector of random numbers using `arrange()` from `dplyr`

1. Assign the first n to your sample using `case_when()` and `mutate()`

---

# Sampling

## Exercise 2: Select a sample of villages

- Create a vector of random numbers in `hh`

```{r}
villages_sample <-
  villages %>%
  mutate(random = runif(nrow(villages)))
```

- Sort by the variable `random`

```{r}
villages_sample <-
  villages_sample %>%
  arrange(random)
```
