# Creating outputs

- Until now, we've seen how to produce dataframes or data table file outputs (`.Rds` and `.csv` files)

- Today we'll see how to produce file outputs with more finalized results, namely descriptive statistics table and data visualizations

- The objective of this is that the concept of reproducibility can also be also be applied not only in your data work but in your reports as well <font size="3">(though that's something we're not covering in this course)</font>

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="90%"}

```

# Creating outputs

## .red[Not reproducible]

Anything that requires
`r fa("paste", fill = "#ac142a")` Copy-pasting
`r fa("paintbrush", fill = "#ac142a")` Manual formatting after exported

--

## .green[Reproducible]

`r fa("r-project", fill = "#046307")` R Markdown: dynamic document containing code and text that is exported directly from R into PDF, HTML, Word, Power Point and other formats 
`r fa("file-lines", fill= "#046307")` LaTeX: typesetting system used for scientific publications that automatically reloads tables and figures every time the document is rendered 

---

# Creating outputs

## In R

- As usual, there are several options for producing descriptive tables and data visualization in R. Today we'll use:

- **modelsummary:** a package for creating descriptive statistics and regression tables

- **huxtable:** a package for creating HTML, Latex, and Excel tables from R

- **ggplot2:** the absolute benchmarkfor data visualization in R, based on a grammar of graphics syntax

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="60%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/session4/outputs-packages-logos.png")
```

---

# Creating outputs

## Exercise 1: Install and load packages for generating outputs

1. Install `modelsummary` and `huxtable` with:

  + `install.packages("modelsummary")`
  + `install.packages("huxtable")`

2. Load all the libraries we'll use with:

  + `library(here)`
  + `library(dplyr)`
  + `library(janitor)`
  + `library(modelsummary)`
  + `library(huxtable)`
  + `library(ggplot2)`

---

# Creating outputs

## Exercise 2: Read the data

- Use `here()` and `readRDS()` to read the file in `DataWork/data/intermediate/clean/LWH-households-clean.Rds`

```{r eval=FALSE}
path  <- here("DataWork", "data", "intermediate", "clean")
df_hh <- readRDS(here(path, "LWH-households-clean.Rds"))
```

- Inspect the dataframe with `View()`

```{r echo=FALSE}
path  <- here("Data", "DataWork", "data", "intermediate", "clean")
df_hh <- readRDS(here(path, "LWH-households-clean.Rds"))
```

# Data exploration

---

# Data exploration

## Knowing your data better

- Before starting to produce outputs, it's useful to explore your data so you will know what to export

- You already know `View()`, `nrow()`, and `colnames()`. Some other functions are:

  + `glimpse()`: prints a dataframe in the console (from `dplyr`)
  
  + `head()`: prints the first six observations of a dataframe
  
  + `tail()`: prints the last six observations of a datafrma
  
  + `dim()`: returns a size-two vector with the number of rows and columns in a dataframe

---

# Data exploration

## Exercise 3: Exploration with dataframe and column summaries

1. Print the summary of `df_hh`

2. Print the summary of the column `inc_01` of `df_hh` (use the `$` operator)

---

# Data exploration

```{r}
# Summary of a dataframe
summary(df_hh)
```

---

# Data exploration

```{r}
# Summary of a dataframe column
summary(df_hh$inc_01)
```

---

# Data exploration

## Tabulations

- `summary()` is useful to explore quantitative variables

- However, it's not great for character or factor variables

- We'll use `tabyl()` in these cases, from the package `janitor`

- `tabyl()` generates frequency tables from dataframe columns

---

# Data exploration

## Exercise 4: Exploration with tabulations

- Tabulate the variable `id_09` (district) of `df_hh` with:

```{r eval=FALSE}
df_hh %>% tabyl(id_09)
```

- Tabulate the variables `id_08` (sector) and `id_09` (district) with:
```{r eval=FALSE}
df_hh %>% tabyl(id_08, id_09)
```

---

# Data exploration

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Tabulating district
df_hh %>% tabyl(id_09)
```

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# Tabulating district
df_hh %>% tabyl(id_09) %>% knitr::kable()
```

---

# Data exploration

```{r}
# Cross-tabulating sector and district
df_hh %>% tabyl(id_08, id_09) %>% knitr::kable()
```

# Descriptive tables

# Descriptive tables

## What if you want to...

- ...export the summary statistics to another software?

- ...customize which statistics to display?

- ...format the table?

--

## Well, then you will need a few more packages

- There are many packages that can be used both for displaying and exporting summary statistics

- Today we will show you a combination of two packages: `modelsummary` and `huxtable`

- We chose this combination because together, they can perform all the tasks we are interested in

- In fact, `modelsummary` can perform most of them by itself -- with the exception of exporting formatted tables to Excel

---

# Descriptive tables

`modelsummary` contains a family of functions called *datasummary* which can be used to create different types of summary statistics tables. These include:

- `datasummary_skim()`, to create descriptive statistics tables

- `datasummary_balance()`, to create balance tables

- `datasummary_correlation()`, to create a correlation table

- `datasummary_crosstab()`, to create a twoway tabulation

- `datasummary()`, to create customized descriptive statistics tables

---

# Descriptive tables

- `datasummary_skim()` produces a quick summary table of numerical or categorical variables

```{r, eval = F}
datasummary_skim(
  data,
  type = "numeric",
  output = "default",
  ...
)
```

- It uses the following arguments:

  + `data`: the data set to be summarized, the only required argument
  + `type =`: type of variables in the dataframe to be described
  + `output =`: the type of output desired
  + `...`: additional options allow for formatting customization, such as including notes and titles

- Its most basic use is `datasummary_skim(df_name)` to describe numeric variables

---

# Descriptive tables

## Exercise 5: Producing a basic descriptive table

- Use `datasummary_skim()` to create a descriptive statistics table for `df_hh`

---

# Descriptive tables

```{r eval=FALSE}
df_hh %>% datasummary_skim()
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
df_hh %>% datasummary_skim()
```

---

# Descriptive tables

- `datasummary_skim()` summarizes only numeric variables by default

- To summarize categorical variables, use the argument `type`

```{r warning=FALSE}
# Selecting only one variables so table fits
df_hh %>% select(id_09) %>% datasummary_skim(type = "categorical")
```

---

# Descriptive tables

- Other than `datasummary_skim()`, we can use `datasummary()` to customize the variables and statistics to include using a formula

```{r eval = F}
datasummary(
  var1 + var2 + var3 ~ stat1 + stat2 + stat3 + stat4,
  data = data
)
```

- The arguments of `datasummary()` are:

  + `formula`: a two-sided formula to describe the table: rows ~ columns
  
  + `data=`: the data set to be summarized
  
  + *...:* additional options allow for formatting customization

---

# Descriptive tables

## Exercise 6: Producing a table with more information

- Create a table showing the number of observations, mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and median value for the variables `inc_01`-`inc_04` in `df_hh` with the code below

```{r eval=FALSE}
datasummary(
  inc_01 + inc_03 + inc_06 ~ N + Mean + SD + Median + Min + Max,
  data = df_hh
)
```

---

# Descriptive tables

```{r warning=FALSE}
datasummary(
  inc_01 + inc_03 + inc_06 ~ N + Mean + SD + Median + Min + Max,
  data = df_hh
)
```

---

# Descriptive tables

- The package `modelsummary` doesn't offer an option to export tables to Excel

- To do that, we will first store the result of `datasummary()` into an object of type "huxtable"

- This will allow us to use the function `quick_xlsx()` from the package `huxtable` to export the table

---

# Descriptive tables

## Exercise 7: Exporting descriptive tables to Excel

1. Save the last table you created to and object called `descriptives_income` and add the argument `output = "huxtable"`

2. Export this object to Excel with `quick_xlsx()`

```{r eval=FALSE}
descriptives_income <-
  datasummary(
    inc_01 + inc_03 + inc_06 ~ N + Mean + SD + Median + Min + Max,
    data = df_hh,
    output = "huxtable"
  )

# Exporting
quick_xlsx(
  descriptives_income,
  file = here("DataWork", "outputs", "tables", "descriptives_income.xlsx")
)
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Storing summary table into a huxtable object
desc_income <-
  datasummary(
    inc_01 + inc_03 + inc_06 ~ N + Mean + SD + Median + Min + Max,
    data = df_hh,
    output = "huxtable"
  )

# Exporting
quick_xlsx(
  desc_income,
  file = here("Data", "DataWork", "outputs", "tables", "descriptives_income.xlsx")
)
```

---

# Descriptive tables

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="95%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/session4/desc-output-no-labels.png")
```

---

# Descriptive tables

- Unfortunately, `datasummary()` doesn't have an option to export variable labels instead of variable names

- However, that doesn't mean that it is impossible to do. It just requires more steps:

  1. Select the columns you want to export in a new dataframe
  
  2. Extract their labels into a named vector
  
  3. Rename the variable names with the labels
  
  4. Produce the table with `datasummary()` and export the result

---

# Descriptive tables

## Exercise 8: Exporting an improved descriptive table to Excel

- Create a new dataframe with the columns of interest

```{r}
df_hh_subset <- df_hh %>% select(inc_01, inc_03, inc_06)
```

- Create a named vector with the variable labels

```{r}
labels <- colnames(df_hh_subset)
names(labels) <- attributes(df_hh_subset)$var.labels
```

---

# Descriptive tables

## Exercise 8: Exporting an improved descriptive table to Excel (continued)

- Rename the variable names with their labels (this will overwrite the dataframe)

```{r}
df_hh_subset <-
  df_hh_subset %>%
  rename(
    labels
  )
```

- Create the labelled summary table with the updated dataframe

```{r}
desc_income_labels <-
  datasummary(
    All(df_hh_subset) ~ N + Mean + SD + Median + Min + Max,
    data = df_hh_subset,
    output = "huxtable"
  )
```

- Finally, export the result

```{ r eval=FALSE}

```
