# Data cleaning

- Data cleaning is the process of fixing or removing incorrect, incomplete or incorrectly formatted data in a dataset

- It has two main purposes:

  1. To correct incorrect data points obtained from field activities
  
  2. To get data ready for indicator construction and data analysis
  
---

# Data cleaning

## In R

R has multiple packages and tools for data cleaning. Today we'll work with three:

1. `dplyr`: a package from the tidyverse for dataframe manipulation (data wrangling)

2. `janitor`: a package for data cleaning operations, arguably best known for its function `clean_names()`

3. `labelled`: a package to handle and generate dataframe metadata

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="60%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/session3/cleaning-packages-logos.png")
```

---

# Data cleaning

## Exercise 1: Install and load packages for data cleaning

1. Install the necessary data cleaning packages for this session:

  + `install.packages("janitor")`
  + `install.packages("labelled")`

2. Load all the packages we'll use:

  + `library(here)`
  + `library(dplyr)`
  + `library(janitor)`
  + `library(labelled)`

---

# Data cleaning

## The first thing: clean variable names

- Uncommon characters in variable names (blankspaces; accents; `&`; `Ã±`; `,`; and others) can make it unnecessary difficult to operate with variables

- Conveniently, the library `janitor` makes available the function `clean_names()` to solve this problem

- `clean_names()` takes a dataframe as argument and returns another dataframe with the names completely clean, without any problematic character

- When working with data in R, it's a good practice to use the function `clean_names()` right after loading data to ensure the names are always clean

---

# Data cleaning

## Exercise 2: Read dataset and clean column names

- We'll load three tidy dataframes for the rest of the exercises:

  1. Data at the household level about household income
  
  2. Data at the food source level about food consumption
  
  3. Administrative data about villages at the village level
  
- Use the following code to load the data

```{r, eval=FALSE}
df_village <- readRDS(here("DataWork", "data", "intermediate", "tidy-village.Rds")) %>% clean_names()
df_hh      <- readRDS(here("DataWork", "data", "intermediate", "tidy-HH.Rds")) %>% clean_names()
df_food    <- readRDS(here("DataWork", "data", "intermediate", "tidy-food-consumption.Rds")) %>% clean_names()
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
path <- here("Data", "DataWork", "data", "intermediate")
df_village <- readRDS(here(path, "tidy-village.Rds")) %>% clean_names()
df_hh <- readRDS(here(path, "tidy-HH.Rds")) %>% clean_names()
df_food <- readRDS(here(path, "tidy-food-consumption.Rds")) %>% clean_names()
```

---

# Data cleaning

## The first thing: clean variable names

- In case you didn't notice, `clean_names()` also transforms all variable names to lowercase

- Remember to use the function `View()` to inspect the resulting dataframes

# Correcting information from the field

## Dropping incorrect observations

Imagine that your government counterpart, from whom you received the administrative data of `df_village`, approaches you with the following message:

*We received word from our data and statistics department that data for two villages in the file we shared with you actually correspond to an area whose administrative boundaries changed between the last two national censuses and they're not part of the area of your study. We recommend that you drop them from your analysis.*

*These are the villages Rukore in district Kayonza and Karuyenzi in district Rwamagana.*

---

# Correcting information from the field

## Dropping incorrect observations

*(...) These are the villages Rukore in district Kayonza and Karuyenzi in district Rwamagana.*

- When doing data cleaning, you would have to remove these two observations from the data

- **Do not remove observations or overwrite the original data**

  + The data you receive from a counterpart or collect from the field should always be preserved as is
  
  + Changes such as this one should be applied when cleaning data and saved into a new data file
  
---

# Correcting information from the field

## Dropping incorrect observations

- The process of keeping or deleting some rows from a dataframe is called **filtering**

- We can use the function `filter()` from `dplyr` for this

  + The first argument of `filter()`, usually provided by pipes (`%>%`), is the input dataframe
  
  + The second argument is the condition to filter on
  
  + `filter()` will return a dataframe with all the rows that meet the condition provided

- However, we should also make sure that the function will work as expected before applying it

- In this case that means making sure that the filtering condition will indeed remove only two villages

---

# Correcting information from the field

## Exercise 3: Filter observations

*(...) These are the villages Rukore in district Kayonza and Karuyenzi in district Rwamagana.*

- Use this code to subset the rows of interest and make sure that they are indeed two

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Note that district names in df_village are uppercase
df_village %>%
  filter((district == "KAYONZA" & village == "Rukore") |
         (district == "RWAMAGANA" & village == "Karuyenzi")) %>%
  nrow()
```

- If the result was 2, then proceed to save the result of filtering into a new dataframe named `df_village_subset`

- You will have to add a negation operator (`!`) in front of each of the two conditions and separate them by an "and" (`&`) operator instead of "or" (`|`)

---

# Correcting information from the field

```{r}
df_village_subset <-
  df_village %>%
  filter(!(district == "KAYONZA" & village == "Rukore") &
         !(district == "RWAMAGANA" & village == "Karuyenzi"))
```

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="60%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/session3/env-filter.png")
```

---

# Correcting information from the field

## Replacing data points

- `filtering()` is useful when you have to delete entire observations you received from field work

- More frequently, however, you'll have to correct single data points instead of deleting an observation

- Imagine, for example, that you receive a message from the team in the field saying this:

*Our team in charge of data verification re-surveyed one household and discovered that food consumption information had been registered incorrectly. The household has ID 3233 and the correct value is 3 for how many days flour was consumed in the last week, instead of the 43 that was registered*

---

# Correcting information from the field

## Replacing data points

*(...) The household has ID 3233 and the correct value is 3 for how many days flour was consumed in the last week, instead of the 43 that was registered*

- We'll use the functions `mutate()` and `case_when()` for this, both from `dplyr`

- Also, remember that here again this correction should not be done directly in the original data file generated from the field work

- Instead, it should be fixed using code and the result be saved in a new file

---

# Correcting information from the field

## Exercise 4: Replacing data points

*(...) The household has ID 3233 and the correct value is 3 for how many days flour was consumed in the last week, instead of the 43 that was registered*

- Use the following code to replace the data point correctly:

```{r}
df_food_corrected <-
  df_food %>%
  mutate(exp25 = case_when(id_05 == 3233 & food == "Flour" ~ 3,
                           TRUE ~ exp25))
```

---

# Correcting information from the field

```{r}
df_food_corrected <-
  df_food %>%
  mutate(exp25 = case_when(id_05 == 3233 & food == "Flour" ~ 3,
                           TRUE ~ exp25))
```

Notice the following in this code:

- `mutate()` is a function from dplyr that changes (mutates) dataframe columns

  + it's used to add new columns or replace values in columns
  
  + the result of mutate is another dataframe

- `case_when()` is an auxiliary function that is normally used inside mutate() to replace column values based on conditions

  + each argument of `case_when()` is a condition followed by a tilde (`~`) that represents the value for cases when the condition is true
  
  + the conditions have an order hierarchy, meaning that subsequent conditions are only applied for cases where all previous conditions were false

---

# Correcting information from the field

The resulting dataframe has the correct data point but also deleted the column label! we'll see how to fix this in another exercise later

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="99%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/session3/data-point-corrected.png")
```

# Getting data ready for analysis and construction

Other than fixing information collected or received, data cleaning also gets data ready for indicator construction and analysis. This part of the cleaning includes:

- Drop columns with unnecessary information

- Add or correct variables labels

- Add columns that don't require indicator construction

- Change column data types so that they can be handled more easily

---

# Getting data ready for analysis and construction

## Dropping columns

Not all the information in your data will be meaningful for development research. Some examples include:

- Field work metadata (enumerator ID, tablet ID)

- Columns with information to be displayed in electronic data collection, for example to corroborate a participant's name

---

# Getting data ready for analysis and construction

## Dropping columns

- We can use the function `select()` from `dplyr` for this

- `select()` is normally used by specifying the column name you want to keep from an input dataframe

- Additionally, it can also be used to remove columns by provide a "negative selection", as in the following example

---

# Getting data ready for analysis and construction

## Exercise 5: Drop columns in a dataframe

1. Inspect the household dataframe with `View(df_hh)` and notice if any column contains information unlikely to be needed for data analysis

  + Look variables for field work metadata or field work confirmations

2. Drop these unnecessary columns with the following code:

```{r}
df_hh_less_cols <-
  df_hh %>%
  select(-c(device_id,
            sim_number,
            id_10_confirm,
            id_10_corrected))
```

---

# Getting data ready for analysis and construction

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Another option using a function for easier selection
df_hh_less_cols <-
  df_hh %>%
  select(-c(device_id,
            sim_number,
            starts_with("id_10_"))
# note that the starts_with() here selects id_10_confirm and id_10_corrected
```

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/session3/env-negative-select.png")
```
